/**
 * The Dots class is a GUI which allows the user to add red, green, or blue
 * dots to a black screen. The user chooses the color of the Dot he or she
 * wants to add by pressing either the 1, 2, or 3 key. If the user clicks
 * on a Dot that is currently on the screen, that Dot should be removed
 * from view.
 *
 * The only method that you need to add to is the start method, but you should
 * read the other comments in the code, as they may help you come up with your
 * solution. Note that you must use your SinglyLinkedList class to store the
 * Dots that are currently on the screen. When a user clicks the screen, you
 * first check every Dot in the LinkedList to see if the user clicked on that
 * Dot. If a Dot was clicked, remove that Dot from the screen. If no Dot was
 * clicked, add a new Dot at the location that was clicked. Solutions that
 * do not make use of a linked list in this way will lose points.
